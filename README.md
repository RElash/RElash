I am a Data Scientist with 5 years' experience developing algorithms. Passionate about simplifying technology, I teach others to use it to improve their lives. My Ph.D. research at the University of South Florida focused on utilizing machine learning to optimize strawberry crop quality and supply chain efficiency. I gained valuable data analysis experience during my internship at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center. I utilized Python for qualitative data analysis, automation, classification, visualization, and cleaning and even developed a recommendation system employing NLP to enhance program evaluation and improvement. As a graduate teaching assistant, I have 5+ years of experience in teaching, I successfully taught graduate courses in Random Processes and Deep Learning, demonstrating my strong communication and pedagogical abilities.
